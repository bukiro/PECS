Placing an aeon stone in this indentation provides you all the benefits of having the aeon stone orbiting your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. You invest a wayfinder and the aeon stone within it simultaneously, and they count as only one item toward your investiture limit. An invested aeon stone slotted in a wayfinder also grants its resonant power.\n\nIf you have more than one wayfinder with an invested aeon stone on your person at a given time, destructive interference from their resonance prevents you from gaining benefits from any of them. You can still benefit from additional aeon stones orbiting your head, just not in wayfinders.\n\nAll Pathfinders have access.",
