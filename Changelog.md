## 1.0.0

- First published PECS in a way that presupposes that other people could want to use it - with a readme and a version number and all, and without development files included.
- App is fully functional, but with core content missing.

## 1.0.1

- After applying some errata, certain containers have been removed, and all characters now receive a second default inventory for worn tools.

## 1.0.2

- Monks created before version 1.0.2 will lose their skill increases from Path to Perfection, and gain matching feature choices instead.
- A Foundry VTT integration allows you to send your dice rolls to a FVTT session. This requires the External Dice Roll Connector module to be enabled in FVTT.
