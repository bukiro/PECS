Bond Conservation,1A,,,,The last action you used was Drain Bonded Item.,,"By carefully manipulating the arcane energies stored in your bonded item as you drain it, you can conserve just enough power to cast another, slightly weaker spell. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell using the energy from Drain Bonded Item, you gain an extra use of Drain Bonded Item. You must use this extra use of Drain Bonded Item before the end of your next turn or you lose it, and you can use this additional use only to cast a spell 2 or more levels lower than the first spell cast with Drain Bonded Item.",,15,Bond Conservation,Bond Conservation,,Manipulate,Metamagic,Wizard,,
Overwhelming Energy,1A,,,,,,"You alter your spells to overcome resistances. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell ignores an amount of the target’s resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage equal to your level. This applies to all damage the spell deals, including persistent damage and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell, such as the wall created by wall of fire. A creature’s immunities are unaffected.",,,,,,Druid,Manipulate,Metamagic,Sorcerer,Wizard
Quickened Casting,Free,once per day,,144000,,,"If your next action is to cast a cantrip or a spell that is at least 2 levels lower than the highest level spell you can cast, reduce the number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).",This can only be used on a cantrip or spell from the class matching the one you gained this feat from.,,,,,Bard,Concentrate,Metamagic,Sorcerer,Wizard
Magic Sense,Free,,TRUE,,,Your turn begins or ends.,"You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your vicinity. You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were always using a 1st-level detect magic spell. This detects magic in your field of vision only. When you Seek, you gain the benefits of a 3rd-level detect magic spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.",,-1,Magic Sense,Magic Sense,,Detection,Divination,Sorcerer,Wizard,
Effortless Concentration,,,,,,Your turn begins.,"You maintain a spell with hardly a thought. You immediately gain the effects of the Sustain a Spell action, allowing you to extend the duration of one of your active class spells.",,,,,,Bard,Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard,
Spell Tinker,,,,,,,"You’ve learned to alter choices you make when casting spells on yourself. After casting a spell on only yourself that offers several choices of effect (such as resist energy, spell immunity, or a polymorph spell that offers several potential forms), you can alter the choice you made when Casting the Spell (for instance, choosing a different type of damage for resist energy). However, your tinkering weakens the spell’s integrity, reducing its remaining duration by half.

You can’t use this feat if the benefits of the spell have already been used up or if the effects of the first choice would persist in any way after switching (for instance, if one of the choices was to create a consumable item you already used, or to heal you), or if the feat would create an effect more powerful than that offered by the base spell. The GM is the final arbiter of what Spell Tinker can be applied to.",,,,,"For spells where the chosen effect makes a mechanical difference, you can select the alternative condition from the conditions menu and set the duration appropriately before removing the original condition.",Concentrate,Wizard,,,
