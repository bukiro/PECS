For example, you can change whether feat choices display feat that you can't take, or whether you get conditions from casting spells that don't affect you. You can toggle automatic checks for any effects your party members may have sent you, and you can even enable a manual mode that prevents all automatic status changes and allows you to finely control your stats.",

The first button toggles between tile mode and list mode - tile mode can give you better overview over your spells or items, while list mode makes it easier to find one. Compact view hides any information that you don't immediately need, such as info tags and skills that have the default value. This makes it easier to find your stats quickly, but remove a lot of control and detail.",
