You gain the Liberating Step champion's reaction and the lay on hands devotion spell. After the tenets of good, add these tenets:\n\nYou must respect the choices others make over their own lives, and you can't force someone to act in a particular way or threaten them if they don't.\nYou must demand and fight for others' freedom to make their own decisions. You may never engage in or countenance slavery or tyranny.\n\n<header class='featureHeader'>Champion's Reaction</header>\n\n<header class='spellHeader'>Liberating Step</header>\n\n<strong>Trigger</strong> An enemy damages, Grabs, or Grapples your ally, and both are within 15 feet of you.\n\nYou free an ally from restraint. If the trigger was an ally taking damage, the ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. The ally can attempt to break free of effects grabbing, restraining, immobilizing, or paralyzing them. They either attempt a new save against one such effect that allows a save, or attempt to Escape from one effect as a free action. If they can move, the ally can Step as a free action, even if they didn't need to escape.\n\n<header class='featureHeader'>Divine Smite</header>\n\nYou punish those who ensnare your allies in bondage. If the triggering enemy was using any effects to make your ally grabbed, restrained, immobilized, or paralyzed when you used Liberating Step, that enemy takes persistent good damage equal to your Charisma modifier.\n\n<header class='featureHeader'>Exalt</header>\n\nYou can help your whole group get into position. When you use Liberating Step, if your ally doesn't attempt to break free of an effect, you and all allies within 15 feet can Step, in addition to the triggering ally.",

At 13th level, if you gain the divine defense class feature, you also gain expert proficiency in light and medium armor.\n<strong>Second Doctrine (3rd):</strong> You're trained in martial weapons.\n<strong>Third Doctrine (7th):</strong> You gain expert proficiency with your deity's favored weapon. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using that weapon, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect; use your divine spell DC if necessary.\n<strong>Fourth Doctrine (11th):</strong> Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.\n<strong>Fifth Doctrine (15th):</strong> Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master.

If the blood magic offers a choice, make it before resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects and, against a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the foe fails its saving throw.

Each spell in the combination must also have the same means of determining whether it has an effect - both spells must require a ranged spell attack roll, require the same type of saving throw, or automatically affect the target.\n\nWhen you cast a combined spell, it affects only one target, even if the component spells normally affect more than one. If any spell in the combination has further restrictions (such as targeting only living creatures), you must abide by all restrictions. The combined spell uses the shorter of the component spells' ranges. Resolve a combined spell as if were a single spell, but apply the effects of both component spells. For example, if the spell's target succeeded at the save against a combined spell, it would apply the success effect of each spell, and if it critically failed, it would apply the critical failure effect of both spells.",
