You cast the 3-action version of either 9th-level harm or heal at any point during your Stride. This does not use any spell slots.\n<strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the spell is 7th level instead of 9th as you stumble through the movements.\n<strong>Failure</strong> As critical success, but the spell is 5th level instead of 9th as you stumble through the movements.\n<strong>Critical Failure</strong> You have failed to remember the steps of the dance. You gain no additional effect beyond Striding half your Speed, and you can't attempt the Dance of Intercession again until your next daily preparations.",
