This frenzy lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall unconscious, whichever comes first. You can't voluntarily stop raging. While you are raging: \n\nYou deal 2 additional damage with melee weapons and unarmed attacks. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile.\nYou take a -1 penalty to AC.\nYou can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can Seek while raging.\n\nAfter you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and you can't Rage again for 1 minute.\n\n<strong>Animal Instinct</strong>\n\nFlagrantly disrespecting an animal of your ally's chosen kind is anathema to your instinct, as is using weapons while raging.\nYou gain the chosen animal's unarmed attack (or attacks). Increase the damage die size for these unarmed attacks by one step, and increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 5 for them. The frog's tongue attack and deer's antler attack gain reach 10 feet.\n\n<strong>Dragon Instinct</strong>\n\nLetting a personal insult against you slide is anathema to your instinct. If your ally respects their dragon type, defying such a dragon is anathema, and if they abhor it, failing to defeat such a dragon you come across is anathema.\nWhile raging, you can increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 8 and change its damage type to match that of your dragon's breath weapon instead of the damage type for your weapon or unarmed attack. If you do this, your Rage action gains the arcane and evocation traits, as well as the trait matching the damage type.\n\n<strong>Fury Instinct</strong>\n\nYou don't have an anathema or an instinct ability.\nIncrease the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 6. \n\n<strong>Giant Instinct</strong>\n\nFailing to face a personal challenge of strength is anathema.\nYou can use a weapon built for a Large creature if you are Small or Medium (both normally and when raging). If you're not Small or Medium, you can use a weapon built for a creature one size larger than you. When wielding such a weapon in combat, increase your additional damage from Rage from 2 to 6, but you have the clumsy 1 condition because of the weapon's unwieldy size. You can't remove this clumsy condition or ignore its penalties by any means while wielding the weapon.\n\n<strong>Spirit Instinct</strong>\n\nDisrespecting corpses or spirits is anathema to your instinct; defending yourself against undead creatures is not.\nWhile raging, you can increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 7 and change its damage type to negative or positive, instead of the damage type for your weapon or unarmed attack (choose each time you Rage). If you choose to deal negative or positive damage, your weapon or unarmed attack gains the effects of the ghost touch property rune, which makes it more effective against incorporeal creatures, and your Rage action gains the divine and necromancy traits, plus negative or positive, as appropriate.",

The weapon can't use reactions, and its Fly actions don't trigger reactions.\n\nWhile it's activated, a dancing weapon makes Strikes with an attack modifier of +24 plus its item bonus to attack rolls. It uses the weapon's normal damage but has a +0 Strength modifier. The weapon's abilities that automatically trigger on a hit or critical hit still function, but the weapon can't be activated or benefit from any of your abilities while dancing.\n\nEach round, when the weapon is finished using its actions, attempt a DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the activation ends and the weapon falls to the ground. You can't activate the item again for 10 minutes.",

You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object a 1 minute per Bulk.\n\nPrestidigitation can't deal damage or cause adverse conditions. Any actual change to an object (beyond what is noted above) persists only as long as you Sustain the Spell.",

If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends.\n\nThe image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows.\n\nIn combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell. It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC - 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.\n\nThe illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to <var>var2</var> plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster - for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage - the GM might allow the target to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.\n\nAny creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn't take any further damage from it.",

The wall has the following effects.\n\nAmmunition from physical ranged attacks - such as arrows, bolts, sling bullets, and other objects of similar size - can't pass through the wall. Attacks with bigger ranged weapons, such as javelins, take a -2 circumstance penalty to their attack rolls if their paths pass through the wall. Massive ranged weapons and spell effects that don't create physical objects pass through the wall with no penalty.\nThe wall is difficult terrain to creatures attempting to move overland through it. Gases, including creatures in gaseous form, can't pass through the wall.\nA creature that attempts to fly through the wall using a move action must attempt a Fortitude save.\n\n<strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature can move through the wall normally this turn.\n<strong>Success</strong> The flying creature can move through the wall this turn, but the wall is difficult terrain.\n<strong>Failure</strong> The wall stops the movement of the flying creature, and any remaining movement from its current action is wasted.\n<strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, and the creature is pushed 10 feet away from the wall.",

The wall sheds bright light for 20 feet on each side, and dim light for the next 20 feet. You can ignore the wall's effects.\n\nEach color has a particular effect on items, effects, or creatures that attempt to pass through. Chromatic wall can't be counteracted normally; rather, each color is automatically counteracted when targeted by a specific spell, even if that spell's level is lower than that of chromatic wall.\n\nIf you rolled an 8 when determining the wall's color, creatures that pass through the wall take a -2 circumstance penalty to their saves.\n\n<strong>Red</strong> The wall destroys ranged weapon ammunition (such as arrows and crossbow bolts) that would pass through, and it deals |dice=var_RedDamage Fire| <var>var_RedDamage</var> fire damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. Cone of cold can counteract a red chromatic wall.\n<strong>Orange</strong> The wall destroys thrown weapons that would pass through, and it deals |dice=var_OrangeDamage Acid| <var>var_OrangeDamage</var> Acid damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. Gust of wind can counteract an orange chromatic wall.\n<strong>Yellow</strong> The wall stops acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive, and sonic effects from passing through, and it deals |dice=var_YellowDamage Electricity| <var>var_YellowDamage</var> electricity damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. Disintegrate can counteract a yellow chromatic wall.\n<strong>Green</strong> The wall stops toxins, gases, and breath weapons from passing through. It deals |dice=var_GreenDamage Poison| <var>var_GreenDamage</var> poison damage to anyone passing through and makes them enfeebled 1 for 1 minute. A basic Fortitude save reduces the damage and negates the enfeebled condition on a success. Passwall can counteract a green chromatic wall.\n<strong>Blue</strong> The wall stops auditory, petrification, and visual effects from passing through, and creatures passing through are subject to the effects of flesh to stone. Magic missile can counteract a blue chromatic wall.\n<strong>Indigo</strong> The wall stops divination and mental effects from passing through, and those passing through are subject to the effects of warp mind. Searing light can counteract an indigo chromatic wall.\n<strong>Violet</strong> The wall prevents spells from targeting the other side (area effects still cross as normal). Creatures passing through must succeed at a Will save or they are slowed 1 for 1 minute; on a critical failure, the creature is instead sent to another plane, with the effect of plane shift . Dispel magic can counteract a violet chromatic wall.",

Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a hallucinatory terrain spell.\n\nWhen you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You're unable to alter the program after you create the illusion.\n\nAny creature that touches any part of the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

Each pillar is 5 feet by 5 feet in length and width. The pillars must be conjured on a relatively flat area of natural earthen terrain such as sand, dirt, stone, or clay. Regardless of the terrain, the pillars are always made of tightly compacted sand particles that together become as hard and solid as stone (DC 15 Athletics to Climb).\n\nIf a creature occupies the space where you cast this spell, it is carried upward atop the pillar. The creature can attempt a Reflex save (DC equal to the caster's spell DC); on a success, the creature can either attempt to Grab an Edge or move into an adjacent unoccupied square. If the pillar would rise higher than the ceiling, it firmly abuts the ceiling but does not rise any higher. A creature caught between a pillar and a ceiling takes no damage (subject to GM discretion, such as is in the case of stalactites or other hazards) but becomes immobilized. The creature can attempt an Escape check to free itself, but it must thereafter Grab an Edge, Climb down, or fall from the top of the pillar. The Grab an Edge and Escape DCs are the same as the Reflex save.\n\nAs part of your action to Sustain the Spell, you can choose to either destroy one of your pillars, causing it to immediately crumble into nothing, or create a new pillar, as long as doing so wouldn't exceed the total number of feet of pillar you can create.

While on the Shadow Plane, the targets are exposed to potential encounters with that plane's denizens. The shadows on the border between the planes bend space, speeding up your movement with respect to the Material Plane. Every 3 minutes the targets travel along this border, they move as far as they would through the Material Plane in 1 hour. At any point, a target can Dismiss the spell's effects, although this affects only that target. The shadow bending is inexact, so when the spell ends, the targets appear roughly 1 mile from their intended location on the Material Plane (though those who are traveling together and Dismiss the spell at the same point on the Plane of Shadow appear together).",

The spiritual guardian is translucent and appears to be holding your deity's favored weapon.\n\nWhen you Cast the Spell, the spiritual guardian appears in an unoccupied space next to a foe of your choice within range and makes a Strike against it. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can move the spiritual guardian to an unoccupied space next to a target within range (if necessary) and make a Strike with it. The guardian uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. Alternatively, when you Sustain the Spell, you can have the guardian move adjacent to an ally and protect that ally. If you do, each time the ally would take damage, the guardian takes the first 10 damage instead of your ally. It continues to do so until you move the guardian to attack an enemy or defend a different ally, or until the guardian is destroyed (it has <var>var1</var> Hit Points and can't recover Hit Points by any means). The guardian can't usually take damage except when protecting an ally, though disintegrate automatically destroys it if it hits the spiritual guardian's AC of 25.\n\nThe guardian's Strikes are melee spell attacks. Regardless of the appearance of the guardian's weapon, the guardian deals force damage equal to <var>var2</var> plus your spellcasting ability modifier, but you can deal damage of the type normally dealt by the weapon it holds instead of force damage. No other traits or statistics of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. Despite making a spell attack, the spiritual guardian's weapon is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth.\n\nThe guardian takes up space and allies can use it when flanking, but it doesn't have any other attributes a creature would normally have aside from Hit Points, and creatures can move through its space without hindrance. The guardian can't make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons or enhance allies do not apply to the guardian.",
