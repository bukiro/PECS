The triggering saving throw becomes a failure or the triggering attack roll becomes a regular hit, not critical one. If the source of the attack or effect is an evil creature, that creature must succeed at a DC 41 Will saving throw or be enfeebled 2 and stupefied 2 until the end of its next turn.",
