Your new body begins in peak health, regardless of what your actual condition was at that age. Any physical or mental imperfections -  including scars, lost limbs, and curses, diseases, poisons of 20th level or lower -  are removed, and you regain your full Hit Points. You immediately begin to age normally again, with your natural lifespan extended as if you had never aged past your new apparent age. You retain all your memories.",
