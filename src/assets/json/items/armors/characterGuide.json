While each order has its own flourishes, Hellknight plate is instantly recognizable to any who know of the Hellknights. Hellknights go to extreme measures to punish non-Hellknights who get their hands on Hellknight plate, and the reward is not usually worth the risk, since for non-Hellknights, the armor is functionally similar to full plate.",
