It is distinctive for its bulbous orange eye - crafted from a magical glass bauble - and wide row of teeth. When worn, the mask amplifies your ability to sense fear in other creatures. You automatically know the value of the frightened condition of any observed creature, and you gain a +1 item bonus to Perception checks to Seek frightened creatures. Whenever you deal precision damage to a frightened creature, you deal 1 additional precision damage. If you are not evil, you are drained 2 while wearing the Skinsaw mask.",
