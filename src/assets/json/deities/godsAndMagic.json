Known as He Who Walks in Blood, he slumbers in the blood of heretics and worshippers alike in an immense cleft carved into the base of the Boneyard's spire, a realm known as the Blood Vale. He keeps no formal relationships with any other deities, even his sister, Grandmother Spider, who repeatedly coaxes Achaekek to rebel against the gods and abandon his duties. In response, even though some gods disapprove of Achaekek's methods, few openly defy him.",

It is common for anyone entering into a life change, such as moving to a new town or changing careers, to look to Alseta for guidance. Likewise, birth and death are both transitions, and expectant mothers and the bereaved both offer her prayers, linking Alseta's church to that of Pharasma. Some consider Alseta to be the goddess of teleportation, though she does not officially claim that title. She is also a popular god among some elven nations and cultures, who frequently associate Alseta with the aiudara, or elf gates, around Golarion.",

While many people consider this to be more of a vice than a virtue, Chaldira and her followers feel it is far better to run headlong into trouble than it is to meekly concede to evil out of fear or convenience. Chaldira is also the goddess of light-hearted mischief, insisting that harmless fun, even at others' expense, brings joy and strengthens ties within a community. While not all of Chaldira's followers are inveterate pranksters, most at least know some sleight-of-hand tricks. Chaldira is most often depicted as a halfling woman who matches the appearance of the local halfling community, with curly hair, freckles, and a patchwork red-and-green coat held together by several mismatched buttons.",

Nimbly avoiding any retribution for her antics, Grandmother Spider rewove the strands of fate for herself, gaining her freedom. She regularly pleads with her brother Achaekek to follow her lead and rebel against the gods, and while he always refuses, seemingly indifferent, Achaekek has on one notable occasion proven vengeful toward those who harm his sister or her followers.",

The Seventh Veil is widely regarded as the goddess of illusion magic, often portrayed as a figure disguised by seven veils. Legends state that each face underneath the first six of her seven veils is of a different ancestry - human, elf, halfling, gnome, anadi, and naga -  but the seventh face is never shown, believed to mask the goddess's true form. Some theologians believe Sivanah hails from the Shadow Plane, though the goddess's true nature and form continue to be topics of debate. Even her female visage, while agreed upon by her followers, could likewise be an illusion. Her goals are hidden from even her most faithful, which some believe to have hampered the faith's growth and influence beyond the level of a cult.",

Shax appears as a human man with a dove's head, feet, and wings, carrying countless knives and other weapons all over his body. Shax is most frequently worshipped by sadists, lone murderers, and serial killers.",

In his new home in a remote corner of the Shadow Plane, Ranalc embraced his banishment and became the patron of exiles, shadows, betrayal, and the betrayed. Ranalc had long held a fascination with the world of Golarion, and he was alternately both friend and foil to the powerful archwizard Nex. On the day Nex besieged the city of Absalom with shadowy beings - beings certainly drawn from Ranalc's domain - the Eldest vanished from reality. Although he continues to grant spells to his devout worshippers, Ranalc has otherwise wholly disappeared.

He spends much of his time slumbering in his magnificent Palace of Salt and Bones, entertaining himself with rampages of wanton destruction and conquest whenever he wakes.\n\nKelizandri's worshippers include brine dragons, water elementals, and mortals who revere the inhospitable unknowns of the deep sea. He holds no love for marids, having killed the last Saline Padishah, Niloufar the Great, and destroyed her capital city of Arzanib. The lord's domain on the Plane of Water is the Brackish Empire Kelizandrika, a conglomeration of affiliated brine dragon-controlled realms. The most powerful dragons of Kelizandrika's ruling councils are said to advise the elemental lord personally.",

Since Riam's death, the currents of the Plane of Water have begun to slow, and may eventually come to a halt. Few recall the Empress of the Torrent's name, but cults dedicated to an enigmatic figure called the Queen of the Depths have begun to arise, heralding an event they refer to as the Awakening, and some planar scholars believe these cultists seek to free Lysianassa from her prison.",

That path is never an easy one, but it is one worth walking, and she stands beside those who make the trek. For the truly wicked and those who show no remorse, she has no mercy. For these reasons, her likeness is often found in courts, where she can watch over and ensure fairness to those accused of crimes. Andoletta also places great value on respect for the dead and the protection of children. To offer solace to the bereaved is true kindness and compassion. Children are slates with tremendous potential for good - if they can be guided and kept safe from evil.\n\nWhen she appears to mortals, Grandmother Crow does so as an older woman, gray-haired, wrinkled, and with keen, knowing eyes. She carries a walking stick and wears a cape of black crow feathers across her shoulders, giving the appearance of large, folded wings. Those who appeal to Andoletta include elders, the conflicted, the bereaved, the falsely accused, investigators, and judges.",

They encourage their followers to try new things, to think in new ways, and to wear new forms.\n\nWhen appearing to mortals, the Spirit of Abandon most commonly appears in that person's own body so the person may see how beautiful and perfect their own form is - after all, if a divine being has chosen to wear it, it must be perfect. For people who don't fit in the body they currently wear, Arshea often appears in the form reflected in their heart and soul. Followers of Arshea are a varied lot, from artists to explorers, and from lovers to those who fight against repression.",

For the living, she leads the lonely out of their difficult times, her lights guiding lost wanderers back to safety. For the dead, her haunting moonlit dances lead lost and lonely spirits onward to their eternal judgment. She encourages her followers to steer those who are lost - whether in the wilderness or in their hearts - to where they need to go.

Her features are difficult to see unless under moonlight, when they instead become crystal clear. She wears a beautiful gown woven from starlight that always sways in motion, and she never appears to be standing still. On her brow she wears a wreath of many-colored moss.

The Black Butterfly finds the silence of the sea of stars useful for introspection and learning about oneself. Those who follow her take opportunities when they can to sit in silent meditation, in zones of silence and darkness when possible. Travel across large distances offers plenty to think about and contemplate, and the Black Butterfly encourages such journeys. She hates all evil, but she truly despises the powerful beings of evil that populate the Dark Tapestry, and her followers are expected to fight these beings and their followers without mercy.\n\nThe Silence Between manifests as the silhouette of a woman with butterfly wings, and white hair and eyes. Her wings contain a shadow - or reflection - of all of the Dark Tapestry and everything within it. Parted lovers, the isolated, the introverted, those who have sworn vows of silence or don't communicate verbally, stargazers, explorers, and the melancholy are all found among the followers of the Black Butterfly.",

The strength of womanhood is a hallmark of femininity, and strength in arms reflects this, with the flourish and personality of a fighting style a vibrant means for self-expression. Followers of Falayna learn to fight so they can both express their body and defend themselves if necessary, and strive to feel beautiful doing so, both in form and in dress. Falayna also enjoys rings, and as such she is associated with events in which rings are given or exchanged, such as weddings.\n\nWhen the Warrior's Ring appears to mortals, her form is most often that of a muscular woman with the hair and eye colors most commonly associated with feminine beauty in the mortal's mind. She wears a bright silver breastplate on top of flowing, silken robes, her longsword Betrothal sheathed across her back. On her fingers she wears rings of varying colors, styles, and stones; this jewelry seems to constantly shift, as if her fingers wear all the rings found in all the worlds. Followers of Falayna include warriors, soldiers, squires, jewelers, and those engaged to be married.",

Korada's dedication to peace is such that he and his followers refuse to cause harm to their attackers, instead using their martial skills only to defend themselves. Many Koradans seek greater wisdom through study or meditation in hopes of better understanding their foes so as to guide them toward redemption. This dedication to self-awareness, philosophy, and introspection is said to have allowed Korada greater insight into the workings of the universe, granting him the great gift of foresight. Korada rarely acts on his visions, however, believing the struggle that comes with true change is always worthwhile, whether or not such a change is successful.\n\nThe Open Hand of Harmony takes the form of a lithe, athletic man donning simple robes. He is covered in sparse, light-brown fur and has three monkey tails that constantly writhe behind him, much like the dancing flames of a powerful fire. Most of Korada's followers are those who have lived imbalanced lives or faced persistent violence as they seek to find peace in their life and within themselves.

This ensures that the map in the sky is easy to read and never forgotten. To learn this map and to guide those who are lost or otherwise in need of direction are exceptional callings, but even more so is to teach a petitioner to navigate the skies themself on the journey.\n\nThe Shimmering Maiden is often difficult to see, appearing to mortals from great distances as a bright, hot star. When she can be seen, she has the appearance of a Tian woman whose dark hair twinkles with bright stars. Her green and pink robes appear as though they are made of light, rather than any fabric.

Born of the archdevil Dispater and Feronia, a neutral demigoddess of fire, Ragathiel struggles to overcome the reputation of his parentage, and he understands the struggle to be accepted, to be trusted, and to fight against his own nature for the sake of good. He represents strength in battle, wrath upon the wicked, absolution or vengeance for the wronged, leadership when needed, and virtue and duty to the innocent. He expects his followers to destroy fiends when they find them and to work toward truly earning the trust and acceptance of those around them. Those who follow him lead by shining example and can be found on the front lines of battle or any conflict against evil they can find.\n\nThe General of Vengeance appears as a massive giant, standing more than 20 feet tall, clad in golden plate armor that shines with its own light and carrying a sword that burns with holy fire. Five flaming wings stretch from his back, three on his left and two on his right - the sixth was lost, torn out by his father in a fit of fury. Followers of Ragathiel include crusaders, knights, soldiers, the falsely accused, the marginalized, and the wronged.",

Guarding them against those who would defile or destroy them is of tremendous importance, lest people lose memories of who they are, where they came from, and what they have accomplished. As such, those who stand guard over monuments and ruins are blessed. Likewise, those who study monuments to the past and present with respect, or seek to preserve them for the future, are also blessed. Guardianship of others, but especially of those who study and preserve these relics to the past, is also of great importance to Soralyon. As magic is a valuable tool in guarding, studying, and preserving these monuments and people, Soralyon encourages the study of magic, preferably for use in learning or protection.\n\nWhen the Mystic Angel appears to mortals he usually does so as a handsome being beautifully carved of smooth marble, the hues of which range the entire spectrum of the stone but tend toward those most common locally. Followers of Soralyon include archaeologists, historians, bodyguards, guardians, sculptors, curators, and arcane spellcasters.",

Scars are the marks the fight leaves behind, the memory of all the sacrifices made. Vildeis expects total commitment from her followers, who leave everything behind and dedicate their lives to destroying all that is vile.\n\nThe Cardinal Martyr appears as a human woman covered in scars, each forming a rune depicting a sacrifice she has made.

The sea may sometimes encroach on the land, but breakwaters can be built to keep communities on land dry and safe.

She sometimes instead appears as a human woman with the head of an osprey. In this form she wears robes that sway like the waves of the sea, their blue folds foaming white at the edges, and she carries a teak longbow strung with gold.

Calculated, logical thinking is more important to Zohls than gut instinct. She sees patterns everywhere, and she teaches that detecting these patterns brings the truth to light. While all investigations are worth pursuing so long as they don't hurt innocents, investigations that reveal the truth of crimes or other horrors, and that lead to justice being served and victims finding peace, are the most important of all to Verity.\n\nWhen appearing to her followers, Verity is always practically dressed, usually wearing a tunic and breeches. She wears black and white clothing, as these colors represent the light of truth and the darkness of obscurity and the unknown. She keeps her light-brown hair pulled back in braids. On her back she has large wings made of parchment that never wrinkle, whether furled or unfurled.

Apollyon commands his vast army of leukodaemons to spread oblivion like a virus. He wastes no time on trivial acts of violence and lacks the patience to wait for long-term schemes to come to fruition. Instead, his plagues carry oblivion through cities like lightning, decimating entire kingdoms in the span of a few days. His greatest creations have been diseases that corrupt the soul itself, ensuring that Pharasma sends his victims to Abaddon once they've succumbed.\n\nApollyon appears as a hulking, bruised giant wrapped in black leather straps, with the head of a rotting ram. His cloak is stitched from the skin of angels who attempted to rescue the souls he had claimed - after flaying the angels alive, he preserved their faces in permanent agony upon the cloak. Apollyon delights in witnessing the deaths his diseases cause, not in dispassionate obligation but out of self-righteous glee. He sends his plague carriers out across the Material Plane knowing that even if they are defeated quickly, the sicknesses they carry will spread and take more lives than they could ever hope to alone. The moans and wails from the infected are prayers that fill him with more power to launch his next sickness onto the living.",

Holding knowledge from the earliest days of existence, he alone knows Abaddon's true history, but he keeps it to himself. This allows him to exploit opportunities with curious mortals, sweeping more souls into his dread kingdom.\n\nCharon appears as a tall, looming man dressed in a frayed cloak and gripping a lantern staff firmly in one hand, but it is widely believed that this form is a facade. His true face may be unknowable, hidden away at the end of the Styx within his sunken palace, the Drowning Court.

Whatever the case, Charon is a timeless being whose bargains, promises, and bottomless hunger stretch back to the earliest days.",

During an eclipse, he performed a ritual so powerful it mummified every living creature on his world, and his heart was finally full. Dying from starvation but elated by his success, Trelmarixian heard a voice call out to him. The voice mocked him, exclaiming all he'd accomplished was insignificant compared to what awaited him next. Trelmarixian's last mortal memory was of staring into an eclipse.\n\nLyutheria, the original Horseman of Famine, was impressed by Trelmarixian's conquest and took him on as her apprentice, fatally underestimating his ambitions. After Trelmarixian learned all he could from his master, he devoured her and assumed her title.\n\nTrelmarixian appears as sickly man with three snapping jackal heads and putrid, membranous flesh that is constantly dripping and sloughing off his body. As the Horseman of Famine, Trelmarixian ushers in oblivion slowly, watching mortals waste away as their bodies turn against them. He spreads cancer by touch, inciting cells to rebellion, and his breath causes outbreaks of hives and asthma attacks in those nearby. He aligns himself with Szuriel to see that soldiers never make it home to reap their fields, leaving crops to rot on the vine. He collaborates with Apollyon to spread diseases from livestock, rendering butchers' larders barren.

It exists both within and outside the multiverse and has influence over the entirety of existence. Though generally content to allow the multiverse to run its course, the Monad directs its aeons to intervene when events deviate from their ineffable design. Mortal scholars often personify the Monad as the deity of creation, the infinite, and truth. Even so, few worship it, and the Monad pays very little attention to mortal petitioners. Instead, scholars study and plot aeons' actions, striving to discern the Monad's ultimate goal or to uncover universal truths they can exploit for their own purposes. Only a rare few mortals can master the asceticism necessary to connect with the Monad, gaining hidden knowledge and powers akin to those of other divine spellcasters.",

There, masked from mortal sight by a veil of swirling colors, he is surrounded by the other Outer Gods that make up his court, dancing and cavorting about him endlessly, filling the void with the sound of ghastly flutes. Azathoth is utterly unaware of and uncaring toward those few who have come to revere and worship him. It is precisely this blind, uncaring nature that makes Azathoth the perfect embodiment of a blind, uncaring universe. Azathoth's name, however, has great power over the Outer Gods when properly invoked. He has also sometimes been summoned by mortal priests - and though these summons attract only a tiny sliver of his attention and manifest as a form other than that of the Primal Chaos, they nevertheless lead to destruction on a massive scale.",

The King in Yellow appears as a humanoid figure draped in yellow clothing, but there is nothing within the clothes save a shapeless, horrifying presence. Hastur himself is also referred to as Him Who Is Not To Be Named, or simply the Unspeakable.\n\nSelf-indulgence and nihilism are at the heart of Hastur's worship, and he is popular among debauched artists and nobles who recognize no purpose to life other than gratifying their own increasingly grotesque and outlandish tastes. Cults of Hastur are united in their use of the Yellow Sign, a triskelion design that allows Hastur to observe and possess those who gaze upon it. The presence of the Yellow Sign among a city's graffiti is a foreboding indication that Hastur's attention has been drawn there, and these settlements soon find themselves under attack either by Hastur himself - who seeks to draw cities into Carcosa, fueling his transformation into an Outer God - or by Xhamen-Dor, a parasitic deity spawned by Hastur as he walked Carcosa's sewers.",

Faceless undead haunt the places where she has passed, and plant and animal life in the area is especially hostile to the living.

The Crawling Chaos, as he is also known, appears humanlike not because he identifies with mortal concerns or cares for his mortal followers, but because a mortal shape makes it easier for him to do his work: spreading the influence of the Outer Gods.\n\nIn his role as a herald, messenger, and agent provocateur for the Outer Gods, Nyarlathotep is the Outer God most likely to have direct interactions with mortals. He answers prayers, teaches evil magic, and inserts himself into history - all to enable mortal cruelty, facilitate the release of Great Old Ones, and turn whole societies toward worship of the Outer Gods. He was instrumental in the fall of Ancient Osirion, and some believe he led Taldor to launch the Armies of Exploration, a glorious folly that proved the ruin of that empire. There are countless tales of his interaction with (and often possession of) mortal cultists and magicians who dare to call upon him, and they all end in grotesque corruption and death. Nyarlathotep also lingers among Azathoth's court, carrying out schemes under the guise of the Primal Chaos's will.",

Elves have also adopted Alseta, a minor goddess of doors and transitions, as their patron of teleportation and aiudara (commonly known as elf gates). Most elves value magic, beauty, freedom, and friendship as part of a fulfilling life and tend to worship all of the deities together as exemplars of these values. Alongside full-blooded elves, many half-elves - whether raised by elves or seeking a closer connection to their elven heritage -  worship the elven pantheon.",

This unpredictability leads the rest of the Heavenly Court to regard him as troublesome, and mortals to view him with wary respect.",

Perhaps the most famous tale about her is that of Shizuru and her lover Tsukiyo, the moon god. After Tsukiyo was slain by his brother Fumeiyoshi in a fit of jealousy, Shizuru brought the moon god back to life with the aid of Qi Zhong, the god of medicine. Sadly, Tsukiyo was deeply affected by his experience with death, and though he and Shizuru still love each other, the event created a rift between them. Even so, on the days of an eclipse, they embrace as one.",

Just as the legend speaks of their ultimate unity, those who now follow the Green Faith and view nature as sacred understand the interconnectedness of all beings, recognizing that harmony is possible only through balance, and that the cycles of nature are both delicate and infinite. Advocates of the Green Faith therefore fall into a neutral alignment, for they understand that by naming one thing, its opposite is also created; they walk the path of balance between death and rebirth, light and shadow, growth and decay.",

The order was founded in 3988 AR when the gentleman-explorer Aldus Canter returned from the Osirian desert where he had been lost for 3 years. Aldus spoke of meeting a cult following a desiccated angel named Tabris. Tabris revealed the secret history of the multiverse and tasked Aldus with acting as a messenger of mystic secrets. Upon his return, Aldus gathered a coterie of his fellow Ustalavic nobles eager to plumb these secrets. His message was far from clear, however, consisting of garbled and coded texts in an untidy medley of Osirian mysticism, Pharasmin rites, and Varisian occult lore. Scouring Aldus's texts - both those brought from Osirion and his many annotations and reinterpretations penned thereafter - has been the order's primary activity for centuries, even before the increasingly erratic Aldus disappeared in 4028 AR. The Esoteric Order's meticulous research has produced occult secrets and mystical rites known nowhere else on Golarion and hints at further secret lore for the enlightened. The order's greatest accomplishment, however, was averting a doomsday few on Golarion will ever realize was imminent: in 4718 AR, the order's greatest heroes prevented the planet Aucturn from devouring Golarion.",

The slaughter of fellow mortals for the glory of distant, unfathomable beings is not something that should be permitted within a society. Instead, mortal beings must shape their own fate, aware of their own limitations, trusting in their reliance upon one another and their shared values rather than divine intervention and guidance.

The quahs and their most common totems are listed below:\n\n<strong>Lyrune-Quah (Moon Clan)</strong> bat, cave bear, moon, mountain lion, owl, stars\n<strong>Shadde-Quah (Axe Clan)</strong> cliffs, eagle, sea, shark, squid, water elemental\n<strong>Shriikirri-Quah (Hawk Clan)</strong> cloud, falcon, hawk, hippogriff, horse, wind\n<strong>Shundar-Quah (Spire Clan)</strong> avalanche, earth elemental, mountain spire or peak, roc, spirestalker\n<strong>Sklar-Quah (Sun Clan)</strong> aurochs, cindersnake, emberstorm, fire elemental, flames, the sun\n<strong>Skoan-Quah (Skull Clan)</strong> ancestors, earth elemental, giant scarab beetle, vulture, will-o'-wisp, wolf\n<strong>Tamiir-Quah (Wind Clan)</strong> air elemental, cloud, griffon, roc, storm, wind\n\nAccording to their own tradition, Shoanti have lived in the northwestern lands of Avistan since long before colonizers fractured the Varisians' homeland. Yet the Shoanti people still maintain their independence and traditional way of life in areas across Varisia, particularly on the Storval Plateau.\n\nShoanti animism is rooted in a deep connection to the land. Shoanti see the earth not merely as a metaphorical parent, but as a conscious entity whose constant support is necessary for the survival of all life upon it - animal and vegetable alike. Their traditions emphasize connection and the reciprocal way in which the land provides for those who take care of it. The life force of the land serves as the source of Shoanti power and insight, rather than the otherworldly spiritual essence of the Great Beyond common to clerics. This life force is the birth of instinct and faith, and thus it sends omens to indicate future events, warning those with the wisdom to read the signs. Thus most Shoanti hold a profound reverence for natural phenomena as a manifestation of the will of the earth.",
