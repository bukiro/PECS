On a success, the revelation makes them frightened 2, and on a critical success they are frightened 3. In addition, you gain information about the subject as though you had attempted to Recall Knowledge about them using an appropriate skill and received the same result on your roll. You can't use this ability against the same humanoid again until 1 day has passed and you've also successfully disguised yourself as a different person."
