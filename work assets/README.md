Active to-do:

Test:

Next steps:
- Create Pop-up slider for number fields to increase accessibility and save space where sliders are already used - ideally with an automatic component (but it needs to write back into the calling element's value)
- Possibly Create tag that automatically inserts a dice rolling button for the included text
- Find a better way to implement losing all effects from armor (effectively unequipping your armor) from Gaseous Form
- Also find a better way to implement Mage Armor without losing your current armor
- If target is area, or if target is other and targetNumber is > 1, don't show or respect Saving Throw choices for the caster condition (if there are choices, assume choice with longest duration)
- Implement manual mode
- Quick Effects button for Skills and Attacks (and quick removal button for manual effects)
- Implement Icons for Inventory and Spells
- Gnome feats
- Hobgoblin feats
- Leshy feats
- Shoony feats
- Implement Conditions for Poisons
- Implement Armor materials
- Champion
- Cleric
- Alchemist
