Finally, while in the disguise, the rune attempts to counteract any effects that would reveal your alignment; on a successful counteract check, rather than negate the effect, the rune causes the effect to perceive your alignment as evil (maintaining any lawful or chaotic component of your alignment).\n\nThe wearer can Dismiss the disguise, and if the wearer’s armor is removed, the disguise deactivates automatically."
