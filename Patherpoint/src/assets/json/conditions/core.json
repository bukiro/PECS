It generates the appropriate sounds, smells, and feels believable to the touch. If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends.\n\nThe image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows.\n\nIn combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell. It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC - 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.\n\nThe illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus 1d4 per spell level above 2nd plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monsterâ€”for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damageâ€”the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.\n\nAny creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn't take any further damage from it.",

While they are raging, you gain the effects of the Rage action, except you can still use concentrate actions.\n\nIf your ally has the Contagious Rage feat, you can accept their anathema for the duration of the Rage and gain their instinct ability and the specialization ability it gains from weapon specialization, but not greater weapon specialization.\n\n<strong>Rage</strong>\n\nYou gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall unconscious, whichever comes first. You can't voluntarily stop raging. While you are raging: \n\nYou deal 2 additional damage with melee weapons and unarmed attacks. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile.\nYou take a -1 penalty to AC.\nYou can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can Seek while raging.\n\nAfter you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and you can't Rage again for 1 minute.\n\n<strong>Animal Instinct</strong>\n\nFlagrantly disrespecting an animal of your ally's chosen kind is anathema to your instinct, as is using weapons while raging.\nYou gain the chosen animal's unarmed attack (or attacks). Increase the damage die size for these unarmed attacks by one step, and increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 5 for them. The frog's tongue attack and deer's antler attack gain reach 10 feet.\n\n<strong>Dragon Instinct</strong>\n\nLetting a personal insult against you slide is anathema to your instinct. If your ally respects their dragon type, defying such a dragon is anathema, and if they abhor it, failing to defeat such a dragon you come across is anathema.\nWhile raging, you can increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 8 and change its damage type to match that of your dragon's breath weapon instead of the damage type for your weapon or unarmed attack. If you do this, your Rage action gains the arcane and evocation traits, as well as the trait matching the damage type.\n\n<strong>Fury Instinct</strong>\n\nYou don't have an anathema or an instinct ability.\nIncrease the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 6. \n\n<strong>Giant Instinct</strong>\n\nFailing to face a personal challenge of strength is anathema.\nYou can use a weapon built for a Large creature if you are Small or Medium (both normally and when raging). If you're not Small or Medium, you can use a weapon built for a creature one size larger than you. When wielding such a weapon in combat, increase your additional damage from Rage from 2 to 6, but you have the clumsy 1 condition because of the weapon's unwieldy size. You can't remove this clumsy condition or ignore its penalties by any means while wielding the weapon.\n\n<strong>Spirit Instinct</strong>\n\nDisrespecting corpses or spirits is anathema to your instinct; defending yourself against undead creatures is not.\nWhile raging, you can increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 7 and change its damage type to negative or positive, instead of the damage type for your weapon or unarmed attack (choose each time you Rage). If you choose to deal negative or positive damage, your weapon or unarmed attack gains the effects of the ghost touch property rune, which makes it more effective against incorporeal creatures, and your Rage action gains the divine and necromancy traits, plus negative or positive, as appropriate.",

You must have space to expand or the spell is lost. When you cast this spell, choose one type of chromatic or metallic dragon. While in this form, you gain the dragon trait.
