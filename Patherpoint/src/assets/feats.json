Typically, only third mark and fourth mark Firebrands have the notoriety and social influence required to maintain an entourage.

Only rules for good champions appear in this book. Tenets are listed in order of importance, starting with the most important. If a situation places two tenets in conflict, you aren’t in a no-win situation; instead, follow the more important tenet. For instance, as a paladin, if an evil king asked you if you’re hiding refugees so he could execute them, you could lie to him, since the tenet against lying is less important than preventing harm to innocents. Trying to subvert your code by creating a situation that forces a higher tenet to override a lower tenet (for example, promising not to respect authorities and then, to keep your word, disrespecting authorities) is a violation of the champion code.\n\nIf you stray from your alignment or violate your code of conduct, you lose your focus pool and divine ally until you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual, but you keep any other champion abilities that don’t require those class features. If your alignment shifts but is still one allowed by your deity, your GM might let you retrain your cause while still following the same deity.\n\nAll champions of good alignment follow these tenets. \n\nYou must never perform acts anathema to your deity or willingly commit an evil act, such as murder, torture, or the casting of an evil spell. \nYou must never knowingly harm an innocent, or allow immediate harm to one through inaction when you know you could reasonably prevent it.
